# FFT-OF-EMG-Signals
Analyzing EMG signals in both the time and frequency domains is essential for understanding the underlying physiological processes. In this project, we explore the use of Fast Fourier Transform in deciphering the frequency components of EMG signals, enabling a more comprehensive examination of muscle activity.
